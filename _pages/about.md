Hi, Iâ€™m Martim! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet.

Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student at UNC-Chapel Hill, deeply passionate about the intersection of hardware and software. My current research focuses on brain-computer interfaces. Previously, I worked in the [Hardware Security Lab @ UNC](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~csturton/HWSecurityatUNC#:~:text=The%20Hardware%20Security%20%40%20UNC%20research,early%20in%20the%20design%20stage.) under Prof. Cynthia Sturton, focusing on tools for formal security validation in hardware designs. I'm also exploring XR technologies and leading research initiatives as part of the Carolina AR/VR Club, mentored by Dr. Richard Marks.

My work spans computer architecture, hardware design, and AR/VR development. Iâ€™ve prototyped selective noise-canceling AR glasses, contributed to formal verification tools for Intel, and created haptic feedback gloves for VR. I've also worked integrating AI into robots during my internship on the Infosys Emerging Technologies R&D team, with demos showcased to executives from Fortune 500 companies.

Beyond research, I love teaching and mentoring. Iâ€™ve supported students as an undergraduate teaching assistant in systems fundamentals, leading to high course averages, and frequently collaborate with peers to bridge academic research and undergraduate opportunities.
