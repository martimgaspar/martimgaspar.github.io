    abstract={We introduce multimodal neural acoustic fields for synthesizing spatial sound and enabling the creation of immersive auditory
experiences from novel viewpoints and in completely unseen new environments, both virtual and real. Extending the concept of neural
radiance fields to acoustics, we develop a neural network-based model that maps an environment’s geometric and visual features to
its audio characteristics. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid transformer-convolutional neural network to accomplish two core
tasks: capturing the reverberation characteristics of a scene from audio-visual data, and generating spatial sound in an unseen new
environment from signals recorded at sparse positions and orientations within the original scene. By learning to represent spatial
acoustics in a given environment, our approach enables creation of realistic immersive auditory experiences, thereby enhancing the
sense of presence in augmented and virtual reality applications. We validate the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world
visual-acoustic data and demonstrate that our method produces nonlinear acoustic effects such as reverberations, and improves spatial
audio quality compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we also conduct subjective user studies and demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly improves audio perception in immersive mixed reality applications.},
